estimated duration using days. Please consider there will be unforeseen challenges and there will be other work to do. So, adding 1 or 2 days as a
buffer to your estimation would be nice. No explanations. Just list the estimated time breakdown for each task. Please add explanations to breakdowns
that contain coding jobs. Do not add "In summary" line. Just total days to complete. Please suggest a scrum story point (using Fibonacci) for the
total days to complete the task at the end of the estimation. Task description: I want collect chrome bookmarks data in macOS. I want to get all
